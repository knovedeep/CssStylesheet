    <img class="bob" src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/d31vTpVi1LAcDvdm/giphy.gif">
    <p class="p1content big-text">Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of
        technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.
        There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. 
        In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.
        Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.
        Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. 
        In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, 
        such as the decorative or applied arts.
        The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. 
        The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.  </p>

    <p class=big-text id="Vermeer">Remarkably, Vermeer was largely forgotten for two centuries before his rediscovery in the 19th century. 
        Since then, he's been recognized as one of art history's most important figures, an artist capable of rendering works of uncanny beauty. 
        Many have argued the Vermeer used a camera obscura—an early form of projector—and certainly the soft blur he employs appears to foreshadow photorealism. 
        But the most important aspect of his work is how it represents light as a tangible substance.</p>

    <p  class=big-text id="Michelangelo">Michelangelo was a triple threat: A painter (the Sistine Ceiling), a sculptor (the David and Pietà) and architect 
        (St. Peter's Basilica in Rome). Make that a quadruple threat since he also wrote poetry. 
        Though he bounced between Florence, Bologna and Venice, his greatest commissions were for the Medici Popes (including Julian II and Leo X, among others) in Rome. 
        Aside from the aforementioned Sistine Ceiling, St. Peter's Basilica and Pietà, there was his tomb for Pope Julian II (which includes his iconic carving of Moses) 
        and the design for the Laurentian Library at at San Lorenzo's Church. Twenty years after painting the Sistine Ceiling, he returned to the Chapel to create one of 
        the greatest frescoes of the Renaissance: The Last Judgment. </p>

    <p class=big-text id="Rembrandt">One the greatest artists in history, this Dutch Master is responsible for masterworks such as The Night Watch and Doctor Nicolaes Tulp's 
        Demonstration of the Anatomy of the Arm. But he is particularly know for portraits in which he demonstrated an uncanny ability to evoke the 
        innermost thoughts of his subjects (including himself through the play of facial expression and the fall of light across the sitter's features.</p>

    <p class=big-text id="leonardo">The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo is identified with genius, not only for masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa 
        (the title for which has entered the language as a superlative), The Last Supper and The Lady with an Ermine, 
        but also for his drawings of technologies (aircraft, tanks, automobile) that were five hundred years in the future.</p>
